 ## Kotlin/Native library format

**WARNING**: the format is *very* preliminary. It is subject to change right under your fingers.

Kotlin/Native libraries are zip files containing predefined drectory structure.
An examplar library looks like that:

**foo.klib** when unpacked as **foo/** gives us:

  - foo/
    - $platform/
      - kotlin/
        - Kotlin compiled to LLVM bitcode.
      - native/
        - Bitcode files of additional native objects.
    - $another_platform/
      - There can be several platform specific kotlin and native pairs.
    - linkdata/
      - A set of ProtoBuf files with serialized linkage metadata.
    - resources/
      - General resources such as images. (Not used yet).
    - manifest - A file in *java property* format describing the library.

    An exemplar layout can be found in **klib** directory of your installation.

 ## Library search sequence

When given **-library foo** flag, the compiler searches the libraries in the following order:

    * Current compilation directory or an absolute path.

    * All repositories specified with *-repo* flag.

    * Libraries installed in .konan directory.

    * Libraries installed in $installation/klib directory.


  ## **klib** utility *(not implemented yet)*.

The **klib** library management utility allows one to inspect and install the libraries.

The following commands are available.

To ask the details of the library 

        $ klib info foo.klib

To list library contents:

        $ klib list foo.klib

To install the library to the default location use

        $ klib install foo.klib

To install the library to another location run

        $ klib install foo.klib <directory>

  ## **cinterop* tool specifics *(not implemented yet)*.

The **cinterop** tool produces **klib** wrappers for native libraries. In addition to the above described structure,
it places generated kotlin stub file to the folloinwg directory:

    - foo/
        - cinterop/
            - foo.def -- native library configuration file
            - kotlin/ -- kotlin interface to the native library
